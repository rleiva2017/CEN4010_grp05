    <h3>Brief Bio</h3>
    <p> Hello and welcome! My name is Stephanie, I'm 25 years old and am a Junior here at FAU. I am currently majoring in Computer Engineering and Computer Science. In the picture I am standing with my brother Hector who graduated from here a couple years ago with his Bachelors in Electrical Engineering so I'm kind of following in his footsteps. My job is currently an Engineering Assistant at Belcan Engineering in Palm Beach doing Software Testing for our customers, such as Pratt and Whitney and many more. A lot of module 2's content in this class is directly applicable to what I do daily at work so I'm interested to see how this class will progress. </p>

    <h3>Travel</h3>
    <br />
    <p> Last thing about myself that I can appreciate is this year I finally got to travel to a new state and go hiking which is pictured. I flew to Great Falls, Montana and went hiking in the Little Belt mountains which as you can see was gorgeous. Traveling has always been something I wanted to keep doing but seeing as I am a college student it get's expensive. Although next year is Colorado so the plans are finally there! That's really all there is to say about myself, thanks for exploring my page. </p>
