                <p>
                    My name is Rolando Leiva and it is my third year at FAU.
                    I took this class in hopes to learn the diferrent principles of software engineering.
                    My plan for the future is to get a Master degree in Computer Science.
                    The reason I wanted to major in computer science is because I was always interested in computers.
                    `   Whether it was playing video games or watching the evolution of televisions or smart phones, the future of technology
                    has always interest me. I hope that I can learn the skills required to be at the cutting edge of technology.

                    The first memory I have of gaming is playing Super Mario 64 on the Nintendo 64 with my cousins at my grandma's house.
                    It was at this moment that I realised that I enjoyed playing videoes games. Now I play on a variety of consoles including the
                    Nintendo Switch, Playstation 4 and my very own gaming personal computer. I spend most of my free time playing video games. Even after so many
                    years later, my cousins and I enjoy playing video games. I look forward to creating a video game with my team.

                <br />
                <p> I decided to go to Florida Altantic University because my cousins decided to go to fau before me and I wanted to follow
                in their foot steps. Everyone liked the idea of me going to FAU because it meant that I would be close to home and that I can see
                my family every day. </p>
